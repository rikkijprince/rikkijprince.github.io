      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <div class="steps">
        <div class="step">
          <h3>1. Speak Daily with AI</h3>
          <p>Practice speaking every day without fear. Our AI conversation partners adapt to your level and keep the dialogue flowing, so you build real-life fluency, fast.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <h3>2. Smart Feedback</h3>
          <p>Every conversation is analyzed automatically. You get precise insights on recurring mistakes, hesitation patterns, and vocabulary gaps — helping you improve efficiently.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <h3>3. Targeted Practice</h3>
          <p>Personalized exercises are generated just for you. Focus on the areas that block your fluency, from pronunciation to complex sentence structures.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <h3>4. Human Coaching</h3>
          <p>Weekly sessions with expert coaches ensure your progress stays on track, and motivation stays high. Coaches intervene only where needed, not to repeat what AI handles.</p>

      <h2>Why This Method Works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Daily, realistic practice:</strong> Short, focused sessions that fit your schedule, not a classroom timetable.</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic error correction:</strong> AI detects patterns humans miss and generates micro-drills.</li>
        <li><strong>Professional focus:</strong> You practice exactly what you need for meetings, presentations, and negotiations.</li>
        <li><strong>Behavioral reinforcement:</strong> Retention is engineered through habit formation and motivational nudges.</li>
