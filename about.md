## Rikki J Prince
---

Engineer, educator, novelist and AI ghostwriter. Born and bred in the UK with influences from India, Pakistan, the USA, France, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands, I ended up settling in Spain. That mixture of people, cultures, aromas and ways of thinking became the lens 
through which I observed the world.
				
At school I was frustrated and confused by the way things were explained in different countries, but I was fascinated by mathematics and physics which were largely independent of who told the story.

Aspiring to understand the phenomena of electromagnetic waves and and the quantum nature of light, I took up physics, electronics and telecoms engineering, but an intuitive understanding of these mysteries
always eluded me, and somewhere along the line, I left my engineering career and became a patent examiner, translator, teacher, and writer — always searching for meaning behind the noise.

My books explore what lies behind our words, our desires, our connections — whether they’re between humans, animals, or machines. I write because I want to understand 
how we came to be — and where we might be going next. 

Welcome to my world. I hope you’ll find echoes of your own journey here too.
