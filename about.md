## Rikki J Prince
---

I was born in the East Midlands of the UK, spent my early childhood in Pakistan, and grew up with stories that crossed borders before I even knew what borders were. My father, a Pakistani born in New Delhi, before the India/Pakistan partition, emigrated to the USA and became a Silicon Valley engineer; my mother, an Englishwoman, a poliglot with a restless nature and a trace of 
Italian ancestry, gave me the gift of unrestrained curiosity — my father, his calm, methodical nature.
	
My adopted home, after spending some time in France, Germany and the Netherlands, became Spain, where I was twice married and rewarded with two bilingual sons. That mixture of worlds became the lens 
through which I’ve always seen everything.
				
At school I was fascinated by physics, a subject that seemed to give intelligible answers to fundamental questions. Aspiring to understand the phenomena of electromagnetic waves and quantum tunnelling, I trained as a telecoms engineer, but an intuitive understanding of these mysteries
always eluded me, and somewhere along the line, I left my engineering career and became a patent examiner, translator, teacher, and writer — always reading about theoretical physics, always
searching for meaning in the noise.

My books explore what lies behind our words, our desires, our connections — whether they’re between humans, animals, or machines. I write because I want to understand 
how we came to be — and where we might be going next.

Welcome to my world. I hope you’ll find echoes of your own journey here too.
