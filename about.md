## About me, Rikki J
<br>	
Engineer, educator, novelist and AI ghostwriter. Born and bred in the UK with influences from India, Pakistan, the USA, France, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands, I ended up settling in Spain. That mixture of people, cultures, aromas and ways of thinking became the lens through which I observed the world.
<br>			
Aspiring to understand the phenomena of electromagnetic waves and and the quantum nature of light, I took up physics, electronics and telecoms engineering, but an intuitive understanding of these mysteries always eluded me, and somewhere along the line, I left my engineering career and became a patent examiner, translator, teacher, and writer — always searching for meaning behind the noise.
<br>
My books explore what lies behind our words, our desires, our connections — whether they’re between humans, animals, or machines. I write because I want to understand how we came to be — and where we might be going next. 
<br>
Welcome to my world. I hope you’ll find echoes of your own journey here too.
