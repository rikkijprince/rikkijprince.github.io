### *Mystery in Reverse*
Elliot never expected to witness the impossible.  
When he sees a crime scene unfolding in reverse â€” blood retreating, wounds healing, bullets flying back into the barrel â€” he realizes time itself is out of order.  
A man who should have been dead is alive, and a murder that already happened is un-happening before his eyes.

### *Murder Undone*
*Murder Undone* is a razor-sharp noir thriller, blending existential mystery with a mind-bending inversion of causality.  
Can a crime be solved before it is committed? And if time moves backward, is guilt predetermined â€” or is fate just another illusion?
