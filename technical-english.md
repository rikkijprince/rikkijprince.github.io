# Technical English in 2026

## What this book is

*Technical English in 2026* is designed to help learners develop **confident, accurate, and practical English** for modern technical and professional environments.

Rather than teaching isolated vocabulary lists, the book presents technical language **in context** — the way it is actually used by engineers, technicians, project managers, and technical specialists working with contemporary systems.

The technologies explored reflect **today’s real workplaces**:  
automation, robotics, industrial networks, artificial intelligence, logistics, and energy systems.

## Who this book is for

This book is suitable for learners who:

- Already have a solid general command of English (**CEFR B2 or above**)
- Work — or plan to work — in technical, industrial, or engineering-related fields
- Need to **read, explain, discuss, and make decisions** in professional English
- Want language that reflects **how industry actually functions in the mid-2020s**

## What the book covers

The book is structured into three main parts, moving from physical systems to digital intelligence and finally to operations and management.

### **Part I — Core Industrial Technologies**
Industrial production, robotics, control systems, sensors, materials, energy, and predictive maintenance.

### **Part II — Digital & Intelligent Industry**
Industrial networks, cloud systems, cybersecurity, AI and machine learning, digital twins, additive manufacturing, and sustainability.

### **Part III — Systems, Operations & Management**
Logistics, supply chains, quality systems, regulation, project management, and future workforce trends.

Together, these sections form a **coherent technical landscape**, rather than a disconnected set of topics.

## How each chapter works

Every chapter follows the same clear, repeatable structure:

**1. A short technical scenario**  
A realistic workplace situation introduces key concepts and terminology in a natural, accessible way.

**2. A visual systems task**  
Diagrams and system illustrations help you identify components, understand processes, and connect language to real technology.

**3. Precision vocabulary exercises**  
You practice technical terms through definitions, functions, and typical professional usage — not memorisation.

**4. A communication task**  
You apply what you’ve learned by explaining a system, discussing a problem, or making a technical decision, just as you would in a real job.

## How this book fits into the wider project

*Technical English in 2026* is part of a broader approach to language learning that treats English not as an abstract skill, but as a **tool for thinking, coordination, and decision-making** in complex environments.

It connects naturally with:
 
- **RJ Communication Lab** — for guided training and professional application  
- **Hybrid English 5.0** — for cognitive and narrative language development
