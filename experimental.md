  <img src="/assets/images/experimental/Mystery in Reverse.png" alt="Mystery in Reverse" style="max-width: 50%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;" loading="lazy">
Elliot never expected to witness the impossible.  
When he sees a crime scene unfolding in reverse — blood retreating, wounds healing, bullets flying back into the barrel — he realizes time itself is out of order.  
A man who should have been dead is alive, and a murder that already happened is un-happening before his eyes.
