# RJ Communication Lab
### Professional Communication Training for Real Work Situations

You don’t struggle with English.

You struggle with **performing in English when it matters**.

Meetings.  
Presentations.  
Explaining decisions.  
Disagreeing politely.  
Answering unexpected questions.

You know what you want to say.

But in the moment:
- you simplify too much
- you speak less than you should
- your ideas sound weaker than they are
- faster speakers dominate the conversation

This is not a language problem.

It is a **professional communication performance problem**.

---

## Why This Happens

Most professionals learned English academically.

You learned:
- grammar
- exercises
- vocabulary lists

But your job requires something completely different:

**real-time thinking under social pressure.**

Your brain is doing three tasks simultaneously:

1. Understanding
2. Translating
3. Deciding what is appropriate professionally

That cognitive load causes:
- hesitation
- loss of precision
- reduced confidence
- avoidance behaviour

The result?

People evaluate your competence based on your communication speed, not your actual knowledge.

## What This Is (And What It Is Not)

RJ Communication Lab is not an English academy.

It is a **guided communication training environment**.

Each session is a structured professional simulation where you practice real workplace situations safely before they happen in real life.

We rehearse:
- explaining technical ideas
- reporting problems
- handling disagreement
- answering difficult questions
- defending decisions
- participating actively in meetings

You are not studying English.

You are **training professional behaviour in English**.

## How a Session Works

Every 60-minute session follows a consistent structure:

**1. Warm-up Diagnostic (5 min)**  
We identify hesitation patterns and communication blocks.

**2. Guided Scenario Reading (10 min)**  
You activate vocabulary and fluency in a controlled environment.

**3. Structured Questions (10 min)**  
You practice responding clearly and concisely.

**4. Professional Simulation (25 min)**  
A realistic workplace conversation: meeting, explanation, disagreement, or presentation.

**5. Consultant Feedback (10 min)**  
You receive direct analysis:
- what worked
- what blocked you
- what to change next week

No grammar lectures.  
No exercises.  
Only performance improvement.

## Who This Is For

This is designed for professionals who already *use* English at work:

- engineers
- technical specialists
- researchers
- project managers
- consultants
- sales and marketing professionals working internationally

Typical participant profile:

> Competent professional.  
> Intermediate or upper-intermediate English.  
> Communication ability below professional competence.

---

## What Improves First

Students usually notice changes within 3–4 sessions:

- faster responses
- fewer freezes
- clearer explanations
- more participation in meetings
- reduced mental exhaustion after English conversations

After 2–3 months:

- confidence in disagreement
- better presentation delivery
- improved professional credibility

## Why I Offer This Personally

I am currently building a hybrid AI-assisted communication training system.

These one-to-one sessions allow professionals to benefit immediately while the full platform is being developed.

Participants now effectively become the first users of the method and receive the most direct guidance.

## Booking

I begin with a short diagnostic conversation (20 minutes).

This is not a sales call.

We simply determine:
- your work situations
- your communication challenges
- whether this training will help you

If it is not appropriate, I will tell you honestly.

To request a diagnostic session:

**Email:** your@email.com  
**LinkedIn:** (your profile link)

I respond personally to every request.
