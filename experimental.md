### *Mystery in Reverse*
  <img src="/assets/images/experimental/Mystery in Reverse.png" alt="Mystery in Reverse" style="max-width: 30%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
Elliot never expected to witness the impossible.  
When he sees a crime scene unfolding in reverse — blood retreating, wounds healing, bullets flying back into the barrel — he realizes time itself is out of order.  
A man who should have been dead is alive, and a murder that already happened is un-happening before his eyes.

### *Murder Undone*
  <img src="/assets/images/experimental/Murder Undone.jpg" alt="Murder Undone" style="max-width: 30%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
*Murder Undone* is a razor-sharp noir thriller, blending existential mystery with a mind-bending inversion of causality.  
Can a crime be solved before it is committed? And if time moves backward, is guilt predetermined — or is fate just another illusion?
