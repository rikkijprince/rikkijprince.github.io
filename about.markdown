				I was born in the Midlands of the UK, spent my early childhood in Pakistan,  
				and grew up with stories that crossed borders before I even knew what borders  
				were. My father,a Pakistani born in New Delhi, carried the memory of migration 
				in his voice; my mother, an Englishwoman with a restless nature and a trace of 
				Italian ancestry, gave me the gift of unrestrained curiosity — my father, his 
				calm, silent, methodical nature.
	
				My adopted home, after spending some time in France, Germany and the Netherlands,
				became the Spanish Mediterranean coast. That mixture of worlds became the lens 
				through which I’ve always seen everything: languages, science, human nature, and 
				the quiet mysteries of consciousness. Wanting to resolve the mystery of electro-
				magnetic waves and quantum tunnelling, I trained as a telecoms engineer, but an 
				intuitive understanding of these mysteries always eluded me, and somewhere along 
				the line, I became a translator, teacher, and writer — always searching for 
				meaning in the noise.

				My books explore what lies behind our words, our desires, our connections — whether 
				they’re between humans, animals, or machines. I write because I want to understand 
				how we came to be — and where we might be going next.

				Welcome to my world. I hope you’ll find echoes of your own journey here too.
