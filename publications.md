# Publications

Fiction, experimental writing, and reflective works exploring time, memory, ethics, and perception.

---

## Fiction

Stories that use narrative as a laboratory:  
time running backward, causality bending, identity fragmenting, and meaning emerging only after the fact.

These works range from noir and science fiction to literary and speculative forms.

## Experimental Writing

Works that sit between philosophy, science, and imagination.

Here you’ll find books that question how we think, how we model reality, and how language shapes belief, ethics, and agency.

## Reflective & Non-Fiction

Essays and conceptual works grounded in modern physics, psychology, systems thinking, and ethical reasoning.

These books are written not to persuade, but to clarify.

## How to approach these works

You don’t need to read everything in order.

Some readers arrive through fiction and stay for the ideas.  
Others arrive through ideas and discover fiction as a different way of thinking.

Both paths are valid.

If you’re interested in how narrative, cognition, and learning intersect, our *Communications Lab* connects naturally with the creative and conceptual work presented here.
